## String Indices ReadMe
## Write a program that parses the words in a string by providing a numerical index, similar to how ## you would access an element in array with a numerical index.

## Example:

## "Catch me outside, how about that?"

## If you asked for the word at index 3 you would get outside back (for the purposes of this ## challenge, our index will start at 1, not 0).

## If you ask for the word at index 7, your program should return an empty string ('') because the ## string contains only 6 words. Negative indices should also return an empty string ('').
